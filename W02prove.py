print(f'The other day, I was really in trouble. It all started when I saw a very {adjective} {animal} {verb1} down the hallway. "{exclamation}!" I yelled. But all I could think to do was to {verb2} over and over. Miraculously, that caused it to stop, but not before it tried to {verb3} right in front of my family.' )
